# Discord-Bot-Deploy

This project integrates Discord's slash commands or outgoing webhook, to execute a lambda function that will either start, stop or get the status of a cloudformation stack. 
It was originally meant to host a minecraft or valheim server which could be turned on and off on demand, although it could be used for anything that can be hosted in an ec2 instance.
